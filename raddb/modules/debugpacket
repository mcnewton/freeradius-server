# debugpacket
#
# This module is for debugging only, and should not be used in a
# production server (it just wastes CPU cycles).
#
# Calling 'debugpacket' in any section of a virtual server will
# print out all the request, reply, control and proxy value pairs
# to the debug output.
#
# This module has no options. Uncomment below to enable, and add
# in useful places in the virtual servers to actually get some
# output when running radiusd -X.
