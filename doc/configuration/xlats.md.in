xlats
=====

FreeRADIUS often permits strings to be "expanded" to a fuller
value. For instance, the following string

    "The user name is %{User-Name}"

might, whilst processing a request where the User-Name request
attribute is "guestuser", be expanded to:

    "The user name is guestuser"

xlats are additional functionality further than just expanding
attributes; they can do string and number processing, or database
lookups. Although the FreeRADIUS core defines some xlat functions,
many are created by different modules. So, for instance, the
`rlm_ldap` module defines xlats to do LDAP group lookups, whereas
the `rlm_sql` module adds the ability to directly call SQL
statements.

This adds some very powerful functionality to the unlang
configuration. A list of xlats is shown below.
